|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ES2015 via Babel 6.0                   | Optional ES2015 support using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). To enable ES2015 support remove the line `"only": "gulpfile.babel.js",` in the [.babelrc](.babelrc) file. ES2015 source code will be automatically transpiled to ES5 for wide browser support.  |
| Sass support                           | Compile [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) into CSS with ease, bringing support for variables, mixins and more. (Run `gulp serve` or `gulp` for production)                                                                                                      |
| Live Browser Reloading                 | !NotYet implemented :: Reload the browser in real-time anytime an edit is made without the need for an extension. (Run `webpack dev` and edit your files)  
                                                                                                                         |
